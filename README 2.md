# <Bootcamp-Challenge-1>

## Description

In this project my goal was to make the code more clean and efficient. I added alt elements to images so people could know what the image was if it was not popping up on there screen. I changed a few of the div elements to section elements and overall made the html more smooth. As for the CSS I compilied a few things together that had the exact same styles to make it quicker and easy to read the styles sheet, and I also added commits to each of the CSS so it would be easy for anyone to pull it up and understand in human language what I was doing. Overall I learned a lot about how to make code smoother and easy for people to read. I enjoyed it.
